# Gallery Modal Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented an interactive gallery view for the Portfolio Showcase section in your photography website. Here's what has been added:

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Interactive Gallery Modal**
- **File**: `src/components/common/GalleryModal.jsx`
- Full-screen modal overlay with professional styling
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Escape to close)
- Touch/swipe support for mobile devices
- Image counter display
- Thumbnail navigation bar at the bottom
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 2. **Portfolio Showcase Integration**
- **File**: `src/components/sections/Home.jsx`
- Portfolio images are now clickable
- Each image opens the gallery modal at the clicked image
- Enhanced hover effects with "Click to view" indicator
- Maintained responsive grid layout

### 3. **Key Functionality**
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons, keyboard arrows, swipe gestures
- **Image Information**: Title and description support for each image
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- **Performance**: Optimized with proper state management

## How It Works

1. **Click on any portfolio image** in the "Recent Work" section
2. **Gallery modal opens** showing the full-size image
3. **Navigate between images** using:
   - Click the arrow buttons
   - Use keyboard arrow keys
   - Swipe left/right on mobile
   - Click thumbnail images at the bottom
4. **Close the gallery** by:
   - Clicking the X button
   - Pressing Escape key
   - Clicking outside the image

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
const [isGalleryOpen, setIsGalleryOpen] = useState(false);
const [currentImageIndex, setCurrentImageIndex] = useState(0);
```

### Image Data Structure
```javascript
const portfolioImages = [
  { 
    src: portfolio1, 
    alt: "Wedding Photography - Romantic Moment", 
    title: "Romantic Wedding Portrait" 
  },
  // ... more images
];
```

- ✅ Full-screen modal gallery
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape)

## Usage Instructions

The gallery is now fully functional on your home page. Users can:

2. **Click any image** to open the gallery view
